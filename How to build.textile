h1.How to build
MefContrib uses the "psake":http://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake build engine to build the project. Psake is a build engine build ontop of Powershell.

In order to build the projects, execute *Build MefContrib.bat* or *Build MefContrib Silverlight.bat" and the binaries will be produced in the *release* folder.

You may need to allow script execution by running the following command as adminstrator:

<pre>
<code>
	Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
</code>
</pre>	

Also note that the build script assume that you have git.exe on your path.
